- distance between clusters (ie are they assembling over time)
- can we count the number of subunits in a donut

- threshold by size and then count puncta vs bigger subunits

- try finding size instead of number of detections

- infer a process from more timepoints: 16 20 22 24 30

- compare density of knobs in SEM whole cells vs sheared STORM
